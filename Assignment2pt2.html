<p>When reviewing the ADA (Americans with disabilities act) site, I found the site to be very accessible. When doing the easy check checklist, I found that every image had type to go with it, and the title was easily seen. The color contrast for type was high contrast so text stood out easily. The headers were easily identifiable, and the page type adjusted upon zooming in. The tab key enabled keyboard short cuts that allowed scrolling with the arrow keys. Each section was clearly labeled such as the search bar. There were no flashing or blinking images. And image order made sense for the corresponding information.
	When I used WAVE on the site, the application was unable to find any errors but did caution against some redundant links to the same page.
